            Vayu is a young strong and fully grown elephant.
He has a nice family Mom and Dad and siblings.
All Elephants live in the forest near a wide river.

Since childhood, he cultivated his own very large garden.
He has planted a lot of trees of Mango, Banana, and Sugarcane.
also have Coconut and other trees.
His garden is very big to have thousands of trees spreading in a larger area very near the bank of the river.
He is very possessive about his trees and
don't let other elephants or siblings enter into his large garden.

On another side of the river, other animals live.
and they cannot reach to this side of the river bank.
So, river separates both sides of the Forest area.

He spends less time with his herd of elephnats.
Vayu mostly live away from his group and spends time in garden.
He goes to the river and enjoys a good bath daily.
He then fills water in his trunk and waters his garden trees

Vayu lives a very sweet life.

On both sides of the river, there are some big very old-grown long high trees.
and branches of these trees have spread out over the water of river.
Same case on other side of river, because of this
Over the years as time spent
some branches of this side of old trees and other side of old trees
grows and now have very little distance between them.

Recently, some group of monkeys arrive on the other side of the forest to live there and make their living place.
monkeys climb on big trees on other side river and through branches
They jump to branches of this side big trees.

Now monkeys climbs Vayu's trees and eat his fruits.
Vayu comes to see his garden.
Vayu see half-eaten fruits are thrown here are there.
He gets shock and his head spins.

He tries to repel monkeys but monkeys are up in trees.
He sakes trees to fall monkeys but monkeys jump here and there.

Till evening, monkeys go away.
Vayu is very sad, super sad ... super super sad ... super super super sad ...

He figures out how these monkeys reached here.
He finds out that these old tree branches over river water helps them to cross river by jumping from other side big trees.

Now, Vayu calls his family.
His mom dad and siblings help Vayu to break the extended branches of old trees.
They break all branches.
Clean and again decorates the garden.

From onwards days, monkeys can't jump if they did they will fall into river water and flow away.

Now Vayu is again happy.
and take a bath in the river.
He is sprinkling water over him.
